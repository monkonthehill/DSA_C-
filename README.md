📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ (Learning Repository)

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++.

I am actively practicing fundamentals, implementing algorithms from scratch, and improving my problem-solving and debugging skills.
This repository evolves as my understanding improves.

🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Build strong DSA fundamentals

Improve logical thinking and debugging

Prepare for coding interviews

Learn C++ through real algorithmic practice

This is a learning repository, not a showcase of perfect or production-ready solutions.

📚 Topics Covered (So Far)
Arrays

Reverse array

Rotate array

Merge arrays

Move zeros

Check if array is sorted

Add two numbers represented as arrays

Searching

Binary search

First and last occurrence

Sorting

Bubble sort

Insertion sort

Selection sort

Miscellaneous

Time and space complexity notes

Practice and scratch files

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: C++

Focus: Logic > shortcuts

Environment: g++, VS Code

No external libraries.
Core logic implemented manually to build understanding.

📈 Learning Philosophy

Write it myself first

Break it

Fix edge cases

Optimize later

Consistency beats cleverness.

🚧 Status

🚀 Actively learning and updating

📌 Note

Some files may contain:

Extra or redundant code

Debug print statements

Inefficient or unoptimized logic

This is intentional.
The repository reflects real learning, not polished tutorials.
