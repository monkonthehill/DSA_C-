# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ (Learning Repository)

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++**.

I am actively practicing fundamentals, implementing algorithms from scratch, and improving my problem-solving and debugging skills.  
This repository evolves as my understanding improves.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

- Build **strong DSA fundamentals**
- Improve **logical thinking and debugging**
- Prepare for **coding interviews**
- Learn **C++ through real algorithmic practice**

This is a **learning repository**, not a showcase of perfect or production-ready solutions.

## 📚 Topics Covered (So Far)

### Arrays
- Reverse array
- Rotate array
- Merge arrays
- Move zeros
- Check if array is sorted
- Add two numbers represented as arrays

### Searching
- Binary search
- First and last occurrence

### Sorting
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort

### Miscellaneous
- Time and space complexity notes
- Practice and scratch files

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Logic > shortcuts
- **Environment:** g++, VS Code

No external libraries.  
Core logic implemented manually to build understanding.

---

## 📈 Learning Philosophy

- Write it myself first
- Break it
- Fix edge cases
- Optimize later

> **Consistency beats cleverness.**

---

## 🚧 Status

🚀 **Actively learning and updating**

---

## 📌 Note

Some files may contain:
- Extra or redundant code
- Debug print statements
- Inefficient or unoptimized logic

This is intentional.  
The repository reflects **real learning**, not polished tutorials.

### Important points :
* Computers store 2D arrays as one continuous, linear block of memory, typically in row-major order. To find the specific memory address of an element at array[i][j], the compiler uses this mathematical formula:
