📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ (Learning Repo)

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++.

I’m actively practicing fundamentals, implementing algorithms from scratch, and improving my problem-solving skills.
This repo evolves as my understanding gets better.

🎯 Why this repository exists

Build strong DSA fundamentals

Improve logical thinking & debugging

Prepare for coding interviews

Learn C++ by writing real algorithmic code

This is a learning repository, not a showcase of perfect solutions.

📚 Topics Covered (so far)
Arrays

Reverse array

Rotate array

Merge arrays

Move zeros

Check sorted array

Add two numbers represented as arrays

Searching

Binary search

First & last occurrence

Sorting

Bubble sort

Insertion sort

Selection sort

Misc

Time & space complexity notes

Practice / scratch files

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: C++

Focus: Logic > shortcuts

Environment: g++, VS Code

📈 Learning Philosophy

Write it myself first

Break it

Fix edge cases

Optimize later

Consistency beats cleverness.

🚧 Status

🚀 Actively learning & updating

📌 Note

Some files may contain:

Extra code

Debug prints

Inefficient logic

That’s intentional — this repo reflects real learning, not polished tutorials.
